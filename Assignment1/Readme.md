two phases: a presale and a public sale. The smart contract is able to handle the following
functionalities:
## Presale:
● Users can contribute Ether to the presale and receive project tokens in return.
● The presale has a maximum cap on the total Ether that can be raised.
● The presale has a minimum and maximum contribution limit per participant.
● Tokens are distributed immediately upon contribution.
## Public Sale:
● After the presale ends, the public sale begins.
● Users can contribute Ether to the public sale and receive project tokens in return.
● The public sale has a maximum cap on the total Ether that can be raised.
● The public sale has a minimum and maximum contribution limit per participant.
● Tokens are distributed immediately upon contribution.
## TOKEN DISTRIBUTION
● The smart contract should have a function to distribute project tokens to a specified
address. This function can only be called by the owner of the contract.
 ## Refund:
● If the minimum cap for either the presale or public sale is not reached, contributors
should be able to claim a refund.
